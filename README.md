Finally, you can choose English as your mother tongue.
 
In order to make English a 'mother tongue', these quiz types need to be removed from the topics quizzes: 'Translate' and 'Spell'

Note that these two quiz types have already been removed from the theme exams which appear after the topics quizzes.

Both of these require a language other than English.

'Dictionary' button moves to top of page and gets a new name: 'Words'.

Remaining quizzes 'Match', 'Pronounce', 'Listen' and 'Look' are arranged in two rows of two.

A new button, 'Movies', is now created at the bottom of the page, and shows information for users and a sample movie.

NB AdColony, Flurry, Kochava Core, and Kochava Tracker must be included (remove #in Podfile) before Pod Install
